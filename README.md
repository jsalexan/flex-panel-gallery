  ## Description
  #JavaScript30 - Project #5 - Flex Panels Image Gallery

  This application uses the following technologies: JavaScript and CSS. An exercise in flex-box. 
  <br><br>
  Quick demo on making a flex gallery, leaning heavily on CSS. The result is simple, but very cool. 
  <br><br>
  Inspired me to learn more about transition and transform in CSS.
